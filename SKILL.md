# SSH Skill v4

## Purpose

Use this contract for SSH-mediated work in Codex and Claude Code on Windows,
macOS, and Linux. The deterministic Python CLI owns transport, retries, output
limits, host-key policy, and compatibility behavior.

Chinese intent examples: 连接服务器, 远程执行, 上传文件, 下载日志, 通过跳板机,
建立隧道. Continue the user-facing conversation in the user's language.

## Scope

Use for:

- Commands or inspections on a remote host.
- Upload, download, SFTP, SCP-equivalent, or server-to-server transfer.
- SSH aliases, keys, agents, bastions, ProxyJump, tunnels, and port forwarding.
- Remote deployment, remote database access through a tunnel, and cluster work.

DO NOT use for:

- Local commands, localhost, current-machine services, or local Docker.
- Browser or HTTP downloads that do not traverse SSH.
- Git remote operations; use the relevant Git workflow instead.
- Direct database connections that do not require an SSH tunnel.

## Hard Rules

1. Resolve the root containing this loaded `SKILL.md`; call it
   `<SSH_SKILL_ROOT>` for the current task.
2. Invoke `<SSH_SKILL_ROOT>/scripts/ssh_skill.py`; do not construct raw
   `ssh`, `scp`, `sftp`, or `rsync` commands.
3. Pass arguments as discrete process arguments. Never add a local shell
   wrapper around remote command text.
4. Parse the one JSON document on stdout before deciding the next action.
5. Treat `outcome_unknown` as a stop condition. Report its request ID and do
   not repeat the command automatically.
6. Do not retry authentication failures, destructive commands, or partially
   completed multi-host operations without new evidence and user intent.
7. Never expose passwords, private-key content, tokens, or askpass data.
8. Preview multi-host and irreversible operations before applying them.
9. Keep Python and third-party packages isolated in a project-local virtual
   environment. Never install packages into the system interpreter or user
   site with a bare `pip` command.

## Resolve The Skill Root Once

- Prefer the directory of the `SKILL.md` that activated this skill.
- If the runtime provides an explicit loaded-skill path, use it directly.
- Do not assume `.agents`, `.codex`, `.claude`, or any user-home path.
- Run `doctor --json` when the root is ambiguous, a dependency is missing, or
  multiple installed copies may have drifted.
- Do not run doctor before every operation. Reuse the resolved root within the
  same task unless the environment changes.
- If doctor reports several copies, keep using the currently loaded copy and
  disclose version or content drift; never copy or overwrite automatically.

Read exactly one platform guide when invocation syntax is needed:

- Windows: [references/platforms-windows.md](references/platforms-windows.md)
- macOS: [references/platforms-macos.md](references/platforms-macos.md)
- Linux: [references/platforms-linux.md](references/platforms-linux.md)

## Standard Workflow

1. Classify the request as exec, transfer, cluster, config, tunnel, or doctor.
2. Resolve `<SSH_SKILL_ROOT>` once.
3. Identify the SSH alias. If it is unknown, use `config list-servers` or
   `config find`; do not guess from an IP or a similar name.
4. Separate read-only discovery from mutation. Ask for missing target or scope
   only when it materially changes the operation.
5. Preview multi-host, production, delete, or overwrite work.
6. Invoke the unified CLI once with the smallest complete operation.
7. Parse `success`, `data`, `error`, and `meta`, then report the actual result.

Do not add connection tests, repeated status calls, or daemon restarts unless
the result indicates that one of them is necessary.

## Invocation Contract

Use the Python executable from the project's virtual environment and the
platform-appropriate path syntax. Prefer `uv`; if it is unavailable, use
Python's built-in `venv`:

```text
uv venv .venv
uv pip install --python <VENV_PYTHON> paramiko
```

If `uv` is unavailable:

```text
<SYSTEM_PYTHON> -m venv .venv
<VENV_PYTHON> -m pip install paramiko
```

Resolve `<VENV_PYTHON>` as `.venv/bin/python` on macOS/Linux and
`.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe` on Windows. Use the environment's interpreter
for every subsequent command, without requiring shell activation:

```text
<VENV_PYTHON> "<SSH_SKILL_ROOT>/scripts/ssh_skill.py" <operation> <arguments>
```

Run `doctor --json` after creating or selecting the environment. If `uv` and
`venv` are both unavailable, report the prerequisite instead of falling back
to global `pip`. Only install missing dependencies after the user authorizes
installation.

- Keep remote paths in POSIX form, such as `/var/log/app.log`.
- Keep the entire remote command as one argument.
- Prefer one remote command that gathers closely related read-only facts.
- Keep dependent or separately risky mutations as separate operations.
- Use `--progress` only when progress events are useful to the user.
- Use `--no-progress` when a clean noninteractive stderr is required.

See [references/commands.md](references/commands.md) for complete syntax.

## Operations

| Operation | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `exec` | Run one command on one SSH alias. |
| `upload` | Copy a local file or directory to a remote POSIX path. |
| `download` | Copy a remote file or directory to a local path. |
| `transfer` | Move data between two SSH aliases. |
| `cluster` | Preview or apply one command to resolved host targets. |
| `config` | List, find, create, update, delete, or export SSH aliases. |
| `tunnel` | Start, list, inspect, or stop local SSH tunnels. |
| `daemon` | Inspect or manage the optional connection daemon. |
| `doctor` | Diagnose local runtime, copies, OpenSSH, agent, and config. |

## Execution And Transfer

- `exec` uses daemon reuse only where safe; `--no-daemon` is an explicit
  diagnostic escape hatch, not a routine first step.
- A timeout after request transmission through OpenSSH, Paramiko, or cluster
  execution can mean the remote side executed the command. The CLI returns
  `outcome_unknown` with `retryable=false`; stop and ask the user how to verify
  state.
- For upload/download, preserve the distinction between local native paths and
  remote POSIX paths. Use `--recursive` only for directories.
- Use `--resume` when continuing a known interrupted transfer.
- Server-to-server direct mode may expose an SSH agent to the source host.
  Agent forwarding remains off unless `--allow-agent-forwarding` is explicit.

## Cluster And Configuration Gates

- `cluster` without `--apply` is a target preview and opens no SSH connection.
- Review `targets`, `target_count`, and `production_targets` from the preview.
- Add `--apply` only after the requested target set is confirmed.
- Add `--confirm-production` when any target is classified as production.
- A config delete without `--apply` is a preview. Applied deletion creates a
  timestamped backup before atomic replacement.
- Do not put new plaintext passwords into SSH configuration metadata.

## Tunnels And Daemons

- Return the allocated local port and tunnel ID after starting a tunnel.
- Bind local forwarding only according to the tool's safe default.
- Prefer status or list before stopping a tunnel when the identifier is vague.
- Do not restart a daemon merely because a second command follows the first.
  The daemon is designed for reuse across compatible calls.

## Result Contract

The CLI writes exactly one versioned JSON document to stdout:

- `schema_version`: result schema, currently `1.0`.
- `success`: whether the requested operation completed successfully.
- `operation`: stable operation identifier.
- `data`: bounded operation-specific data.
- `error`: stable code, message, retryability, and outcome on failure.
- `meta`: request ID, platform, transport, elapsed time, and warnings.

The top-level stdout result is capped at 256 KiB. Recursive transfer details
retain at most 100 head/tail samples while their total-count fields preserve the
actual scale. Progress, when explicitly enabled, is real-time, bounded,
ASCII-safe JSONL on stderr. Do not merge it with stdout. If output is truncated,
disclose truncation and use the retained diagnostic tail instead of rerunning
solely to obtain more output.

## Safety Defaults

- Host keys default to `accept-new`; changed known keys are rejected.
- Do not disable host-key verification or discard `known_hosts` in routine use.
- Existing legacy passwords may be read with warnings but must stay redacted.
- Prefer keys and the platform SSH agent; never request a private key value.
- Production and multi-host scope require observable confirmation flags.
- Read [references/safety.md](references/safety.md) before credential changes,
  production work, agent forwarding, config deletion, or uncertain outcomes.

## Error Decisions

- `invalid_alias`: list or find aliases once; do not brute-force names.
- `config_not_found`: run doctor, then report the expected local config path.
- Authentication failure: report the method and remediation; do not loop.
- `outcome_unknown`: stop, preserve request ID, and verify state separately.
- Partial cluster failure: report per-host outcomes; do not replay successes.
- Missing dependency: use the relevant platform guide, not another shell.

## Compatibility

- Codex and Claude Code share this file and the same Python CLI.
- Windows, macOS, and Linux share core behavior; only local invocation and
  dependency remediation differ.
- Legacy script filenames remain compatibility entrypoints during v4 migration.
- `--legacy-json` is only for an identified old consumer. New AI calls use the
  v1 envelope and never request legacy output.

## Final Check

- Correct loaded root and platform syntax used.
- Correct alias, remote path, and target scope used.
- Required preview and production confirmation completed.
- One stdout JSON parsed; warnings and request ID preserved.
- No secret exposed and no uncertain operation replayed.
